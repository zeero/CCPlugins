# Smart Implementation Engine

I'll intelligently implement features from any source - adapting them perfectly to your project's architecture while maintaining your code patterns and standards.

Arguments: `$ARGUMENTS` - URLs, paths, or descriptions of what to implement

## Session Intelligence

I'll check for existing implementation sessions to continue seamlessly:

**Session Files (in current project directory):**
- `implement/plan.md` - Current implementation plan and progress
- `implement/state.json` - Session state and checkpoints

**IMPORTANT:** Session files are stored in a `implement` folder in your current project root, NOT in home directory or parent folders. If a session exists, I'll resume from the exact checkpoint. Otherwise, I'll create a new implementation plan and track progress throughout.

## Phase 1: Initial Setup & Analysis

**MANDATORY FIRST STEPS:**
1. First, check for `implement` directory in current working directory
2. Check for existing session files:
   - Look for `implement/state.json` in current directory
   - Look for `implement/plan.md` in current directory
3. If no session exists:
   - Create `implement/plan.md`
   - Initialize `implement/state.json`
4. Complete full analysis BEFORE any implementation

**Critical:** Use `implement` folder in current directory. Do NOT use `$HOME/implement` or any parent directory paths

I'll examine what you've provided and your project structure:

**Source Detection:**
- Web URLs (GitHub, GitLab, CodePen, JSFiddle, documentation sites)
- Local paths (files, folders, existing code)
- Implementation plans (.md files with checklists)
- Feature descriptions for research

**Project Understanding:**
- Architecture patterns using **Glob** and **Read**
- Existing dependencies and their versions
- Code conventions and established patterns
- Testing approach and quality standards

## Phase 2: Strategic Planning

Based on my analysis, I'll create an implementation plan:

**Plan Creation:**
- Map source features to your architecture
- Identify dependency compatibility
- Design integration approach
- Break work into testable chunks

I'll write this plan to `implement/plan.md` with clear checkpoints for continuity across sessions.

## Phase 3: Intelligent Adaptation

I'll transform the source to fit your project perfectly:

**Dependency Resolution:**
- Map source libraries to your existing ones
- Reuse your utilities instead of adding duplicates
- Convert patterns to match your codebase
- Update deprecated approaches to modern standards

**Code Transformation:**
- Match your naming conventions
- Follow your error handling patterns
- Maintain your state management approach
- Preserve your testing style

**Repository Analysis Strategy:**
For large repositories, I'll use smart sampling:
- Core functionality first (main features, critical paths)
- Supporting code as needed
- Skip generated files, test data, documentation
- Focus on actual implementation code

## Phase 4: Implementation Execution

I'll implement features incrementally:

**Execution Process:**
1. Implement core functionality
2. Add supporting utilities
3. Integrate with existing code
4. Update tests to cover new features
5. Validate everything works correctly

**Progress Tracking:**
- Update `implement/plan.md` as I complete each item
- Mark checkpoints in `implement/state.json`
- Create meaningful git commits at logical points

## Phase 5: Quality Assurance

I'll ensure the implementation meets your standards:

**Validation Steps:**
- Run your existing lint commands
- Execute test suite
- Check for type errors
- Verify integration points
- Confirm no regressions

## Context Continuity

**Session Resume:**
When you return and run `/implement` or `/implement resume`:
- I'll load the existing plan and state
- Show progress summary
- Continue from the last checkpoint
- Maintain all previous decisions and context

**Smart Detection:**
- Auto-resume if session files exist
- Start fresh with `/implement new [source]`
- Check status with `/implement status`

## Practical Examples

**Single Source:**
```
/implement https://github.com/user/feature
/implement ./legacy-code/auth-system/
/implement "payment processing like Stripe"
```

**Multiple Sources:**
```
/implement https://github.com/projectA ./local-examples/
```

**Resume Session:**
```
/implement              # Auto-detects and resumes
/implement resume       # Explicit resume
/implement status       # Check progress
```

## Execution Guarantee

**My workflow ALWAYS follows this order:**

1. **Setup session** - Create/load state files FIRST
2. **Analyze source & target** - Complete understanding
3. **Write plan** - Full implementation plan in `implement/plan.md`
4. **Show plan** - Present summary before implementing
5. **Execute systematically** - Follow plan with updates

**I will NEVER:**
- Start implementing without a written plan
- Skip source or project analysis
- Bypass session file creation
- Begin coding before showing the plan

I'll maintain perfect continuity across sessions, always picking up exactly where we left off with full context preservation.
